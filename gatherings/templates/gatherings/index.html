    <h3>WHO WE ARE:</h3>
    <p>
        We are a collection of individuals working to create space and connection in South City. We are normal, counter-cultural, DIY, non-binary, non-normative, creative and experiential people making space for all those who also feel like they donâ€™t fit. We meet at tables, have conversations, share food, celebrate, learn, worship, garden, and care for one another.
    </p>
    <h3>WHAT WE BELIEVE:</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>that we belong to each other</li>
        <li>that we can be brave together</li>
        <li>that we are responsible for our community</li>
        <li>that together we are larger than any one institution, church, political party, or any other identification</li>
